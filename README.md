# 🔥 Dublin Fire Incident Time Series Forecasting 🔮

Welcome to the _Fire Incident Time Series Forecasting_ repository, where we predict the future by learning from the past!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an analytical deep dive into the historical data of fire incidents. Our mission is to uncover patterns, understand the trends, and predict the future of fire incident occurrences using time series analysis techniques.

Our dataset `fire_incidents.csv` is a comprehensive log of fire incidents, meticulously recorded with the following structure:

- `Date`: Timestamp for each logged incident.
- `IncidentCount`: The tally of incidents on the given date.

## Analyses Overview

Each analysis within this project serves a specific purpose and utilizes a range of data processing and statistical techniques:

### 1. Time Series Forecasting 📈
**Objective**: Forecast future fire incident counts.
**Method**: Aggregate data into a time series format and apply ARIMA modeling, potentially integrating with tools like R or Python for advanced statistical processing.

### 2. Response Time Optimization ⏱️
**Objective**: Determine the factors affecting response times to optimize them.
**Method**: Investigate the correlation between response times and variables such as time of day and incident type using SQL, complemented by advanced regression analysis.

### 3. Hotspot Analysis 📍
**Objective**: Identify geographic areas with frequent incidents.
**Method**: Use spatial SQL queries to locate hotspots and employ GIS tools for visualization.

### 4. Resource Allocation Analysis 🚒
**Objective**: Optimize the distribution of firefighting resources.
**Method**: Analyze incident frequencies by station in SQL and match against resource data to recommend allocations.

### 5. Incident Duration Analysis ⏳
**Objective**: Explore the factors that influence the length of incidents.
**Method**: Calculate and analyze incident durations using SQL to find patterns and anomalies.

### 6. Seasonal and Weather Impact Analysis ☀️❄️
**Objective**: Evaluate the effect of seasonal changes and weather on incident rates.
**Method**: Integrate weather data using SQL JOINs and analyze its correlation with incident patterns.

### 7. Predictive Modeling for Incident Types 🧠
**Objective**: Predict specific types of fire incidents.
**Method**: Perform feature engineering using SQL and apply machine learning classifiers to predict incident types.

### 8. Text Analysis of Incident Descriptions 📝
**Objective**: Derive insights from the textual descriptions of incidents.
**Method**: Use SQL for initial text aggregation and Python for advanced text analysis techniques like NLP.

### 9. Comparative Analysis Across Years 📅
**Objective**: Compare incident trends over different years.
**Method**: Extract and compare yearly data using SQL to spot trends and changes over time.
