# 🔥 Dublin Fire Incident Time Series Forecasting 🔮

Welcome to the _Fire Incident Time Series Forecasting_ repository, where we predict the future by learning from the past!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an analytical deep dive into the historical data of fire incidents. Our mission is to uncover patterns, understand the trends, and predict the future of fire incident occurrences using time series analysis techniques.

## 📊 Data

Our dataset `fire_incidents.csv` is a comprehensive log of fire incidents, meticulously recorded with the following structure:

- `Date`: Timestamp for each logged incident.
- `IncidentCount`: The tally of incidents on the given date.

Spanning from **January 2020 to December 2022**, the data serves as the backbone of our predictive efforts.

## 🧐 Analysis

The project encompasses a structured approach to forecasting:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Ensuring clean, coherent, and consistent data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Spotting trends, seasonality, and patterns within the data.
3. **Modeling**: Employing ARIMA to fit a model to the historical incidents.
4. **Forecasting**: Projecting the incident counts into the future, specifically targeting January 2024 to July 2024.
5. **Visualization**: Crafting insightful plots to vividly present the forecast and associated confidence levels.

## 🔍 Methodology

We leverage the ARIMA model's prowess, a cornerstone of time series forecasting. The model's hyperparameters are judiciously selected post analysis of the ACF and PACF plots to ensure a snug fit to our temporal data.

## 📈 Results

Our analysis culminates in a predictive model that forecasts incident counts with an attached confidence interval. The visualizations bring to light the expected trends and variability, arming decision-makers with foresight into 2024.

## 🛠 Usage
